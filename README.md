# genMe-readMe

## Description

This is a simple application that generates a readMe.md file for any project! The app runs in your command prompt after installing nodejs and running npm i in cli. I build this to help re-inforce foundational coding back-end knowledge using node and an npm library. During this project I got to work with the inquirer npm dependency, get a better grasp on the nodejs file system methods such as fs.writeFile()), use template literals, get a deeper understanding of package.json and package-lock.json and finally work with Javascript Special characters such as \n.
